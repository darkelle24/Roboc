Project based on excercise for python on OpenClassroom :
http://exercices.openclassrooms.com/assessment/159?id=235344&slug=apprenez-a-programmer-en-python&login=7311412&tk=ff4699fb2ad702371804b17a23ec17f5&sbd=2016-02-01&sbdtk=fa78d6dd3126b956265a25af9b322d55

The robot is controllable through commands entered on the keyboard. There must be the following commands:

.Q which must allow to save and leave the game in progress;

.N which asks the robot to move to the north (ie the top of your screen);

.E that asks the robot to move east (that is, the right of your screen);

.S which asks the robot to move to the south (that is, the bottom of your screen);

.O who asks the robot to move to the west (that is, the left of your screen);

.Each of the above directions followed by a number allows to advance several boxes (eg E3 to advance three boxes to the east).

The objectif is to go on "U" who is the exit
